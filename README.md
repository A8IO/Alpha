# Alpha
A 28-key semi-ortholinear mechanical keyboard designed by PyroL


# Build instructions
The Pro Micro will be on the **left**, so the “**top**” of the PCB is where it says “Too Many Keys”, and the “**bottom**” is where it says “By PyroL”.

Step 0 (OPTIONAL): Install the stabilizer.

Step 1: Install and solder the diodes with the black line facing the square pad. Cut the excess leads. 

Step 2: Mount the switches in the plate, and solder them all in.

Step 3 (OPTIONAL): place your LED strip on the bottom of the PCB, and cut three wires. The LEDs connect to the three-pin header in between the Pro Micro holes. Connect GND to the hole with a square pad, power to the middle hole, and Data In to the last hole.

Step 4a: Insert the short side of the headers into the bottom of the PCB, and solder them in. 

Step 4b: Mount the Pro Micro on the bottom of the PCB, smooth side facing you. Solder.

Final step: Assemble the case, flash (use my firmware or kbfirmware.com), and enjoy!
