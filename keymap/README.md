# A guide to the keymap

In this document I will go through the basic functionality of the Alpha's default keymap. Several functions are kept consistent throughout all the layers. 

 - last key on the 2nd row toggles the next layer. This is not a hold function, just one tap switches.

 - The key to the left of the spacebar returns to the home layer.

The default keymap is somewhat organized by function:

 - Home layer: All letters, spacebar is shift on hold.
