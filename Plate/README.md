# Instructions

SVG and Illustrator file for top and bottom plate. It is recommended not to import directly into CAD program, rather open in vector editing software and export in DXF or a format that handles dimensions better in 3d space.

Countersinking mounting holes must be done manually with a drill/drill press.

3mm acrylic needs a cutout for stab wire.
